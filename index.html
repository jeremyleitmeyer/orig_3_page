					<h3>Goals</h3>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>	I grew up around tech and video games. Ive always had an interest in it and the lifestyle it involves. When I was a child I wanted to be a game designer but as I grew up and life hit, I couldn't manage that. I worked in the delivery business for 5 years for McKee Foods. They are the parent company of Little Debbie Cakes, Sunbelt Bakery, and Drakes Cakes. The job itself wasn't terrible but it was definitely not what I wanted to do forever. </p>
					<p>	A friend of mine joined NYCDA and couldn't rave about it enough so around March of 2017 I pulled the trigger and enrolled myself for summer classes. I'm hoping this course gives me the opportunity to get a job within the tech industry and make a career out of web development.</p>
